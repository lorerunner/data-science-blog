## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. Which programming language is the most desire in the next year?
2. What biases did the respondents have in proposing different programming languages?
3. How does different programming language related to work hours per week?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/b893238d2aa5/edit).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019).
